title: My data science projects

I would like to showcase a few of the many data science projects that I have worked on here.

This is an [interactive dashboard](https://mikeymice.shinyapps.io/mentalhealth/) with a geographical map of mental health survey results, built with R shiny.

This is a software package I built with my classmates for data cleaning, in R and [python](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/CleanPy).

I participated in UBC's Hackseq in 2018 and 2019. This project worked with the Teracyc ocean project data, which consists of over 300 water samples from around the world, analyzed for viral and bacterial DNA. This was then mapped to biochemical metabolic families by the Hallam lab at UBC. Our hackathon team then visualized this data in our [viral voyager shiny app](https://oganm.com/shiny/taracyc/). My 2019 group project was creating an [antimicrobial resistance clinical analysis pipeline.](https://github.com/schorlton/bugseq-hackseq)
