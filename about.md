I am a data scientist, entrepreneur and speaker wanting to make the world a more equitabe and sustainable place. 
I hope to build transparent, cutting edge software and data analytics to create actionable, reliable solutions to business problems.
I also have a side passion for promoting multi-disciplinary and holistic health research and approaches to advance personalized care for people with chronic diseases related to epigenetics and gut health. I am also endlessly fascinated by how our brains work and the similarities to neural network algorithms.


I strive to live a healthy, happy, balanced life and inspire others to dare greatly and lead with their hearts. My hobbies include rock climbing, soccer, backpacking, gardening, cooking, coaching, podcasts, audio books, yoga, and surfing. I love meeting adventurous, analytical and open people who also want to make the world a more inclusive, equal, sustainable, and peaceful place.
