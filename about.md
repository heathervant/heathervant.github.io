I am a neuroscientist, concussion recovery coach, and data scientist wanting to make the world a better place. 
I hope to build collaborative research and health-care systems to advance research and care for many chronic diseases and expand our knowledge of how our brains work.


I strive to live a healthy, happy, balanced life and inspire others to dare greatly and lead with their hearts. My hobbies include rock climbing, soccer, backpacking, gardening, cooking, coaching, podcasts, audio books, yoga, and surfing. I love meeting adventurous, analytical and open people who also want to make the world a more inclusive, equal, sustainable, and peaceful place.

### More Information
If you would like to meet for an e-coffee and discuss all of the wonderful options for learning and growing in sustainable and synergistic ways I would be happy to talk to you.
