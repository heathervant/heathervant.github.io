# Hi, thanks for visiting my blog!

I am currently very busy with a 10-month Master's in Data Science program at the University of British Columbia, in Vancouver. 
My current life looks like this:

When I'm not madly completing coding assignments and marvelling at the black-box complexities of neural networks and how they may be similar to our own human brains, I am usually out for a run, snowboarding, meditating or cooking healthy plant-based meals (and cookies). Yes, I fit the Vancouver stereotype, and am always looking for ways to add more health and fitness into my life, while hoping to inspire others to do the same. I'm happy to connect via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/heather-van-tassel-49621b3b/), [twitter](https://twitter.com/hvan12), or [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/heathervant/) to discuss all things data science, neuroscience, nutrition, biodiversity, food security, climate change, outdoor adventures, zero waste living, and mindfulness.

I will be adding pages and formatting to this blog, but for now, I'll just share a few of my thoughts on some of my favourite topics below:

## What is healthy nutrition?
Glad you asked. It depends on many factors, but here are some general guidelines I follow.
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -*"Eat food, not too much, mostly plants."
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Michael Pollan*

> Plant-based whole foods are full of vitamins (enzyme cofactors) that can keep your cells pumping ATP and giving you energy to think, breathe, and move. While glucose is your cells' favourite form of energy, the food we eat contains many different variations of glucose, known as carbohydrates as well as other macronutrients such as proteins and fats. Stabilizing blood sugar levels with healthy polyunsaturated plant-based fats and essential amino acids found in proteins as well as complex carbs can help maintain energy levels thorughout the day and avoid junk food binges or cravings. After a few months of eating clean plant-based foods, your taste buds will adapt, and you will no longer crave those salty and sweet snacks that don't add much to your health.

> I recommend checking out Michael Gregor's cookbook ["How not to Die"](https://www.amazon.com/How-Not-Die-Cookbook-Recipes/dp/1529010810/ref=asc_df_1529010810/?tag=bingshoppinga-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid={creative}&hvpos={adposition}&hvnetw=o&hvrand={random}&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=e&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl={devicemodel}&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=&hvtargid=pla-4583726542133522&psc=1) as it has some delicious and healthy recipes backed by a very thorough examination of the scientific peer-reviewed nutrition literature. Dr. Gregor also has a great [youtube channel called Nutrition Facts](https://www.youtube.com/user/NutritionFactsOrg).

## How to recover from a concussion
> I experienced a bad concussion or trauatic brain injury (TBI) and ironically learned a lot from it. While I won't say it was a fun experience, and it probably is not going to add anything to my long-term cognitive functioning, I am still grateful to have learned so much and grown as a person from the experience. They say pain is "the biggest motivator", or "where growth happens", or something similarly heartfelt. Well, I think that's true. As a neuroscience student, I am thankful that I had the motivation and resources to help me navigate my own health journey and really understand what was happening to me on a cellular level. I can only imagine how alienating and confusing concussions must be for people who do not know why they are feeling these symptoms. While this field of research is still very new, there are a few promising treatments available, such as omega-3, curcumin (antioxidants) and creatine supplementation. I like to say that knowledge is power, and I want to empower others to regain their health, which is why I put together a slideshow and recorded an informational talk on my holistic concussion recovery journey, in hopes that it would inspire others to seek treatments and share their symptoms with their support network  to give insight on what a concussion really is. It's realy difficult to convey the scary symptoms that can accompany concussions unless you -heaven forbid- go through one yourself. Here is a [link to my concussion recovery slideshow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1O8699A8tJiSB8LyywPFCP7YTitBrif0VHjsIlTgR0tQ/edit?usp=sharing) with links to more scientific research and support resources for dealing with TBI.

### Instructions for future self

> You can add additional posts in the browser on GitHub.com too! Just hit the + icon in `/_posts/` to create new content. Just make sure to include the [front-matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) block at the top of each new blog post and make sure the post's filename is in this format: year-month-day-title.md

1. Install Jekyll and plug-ins in one fell swoop. `gem install github-pages` This mirrors the plug-ins used by GitHub Pages on your local machine including Jekyll, Sass, etc.
2. Clone down your fork `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourusername.github.io.git`
3. Serve the site and watch for markup/sass changes `jekyll serve`
4. View your website at http://127.0.0.1:4000/
5. Commit any changes and push everything to the master branch of your GitHub user repository. GitHub Pages will then rebuild and serve your website.
