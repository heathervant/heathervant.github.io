title: Git has changed my past present and future.
---

I would like to focus my first blog post on one learning topic that I have been introduced to during the masters of Data Science program at UBC. Having made it past week two of the MDS program, the topic that i was thrilled to start learning is git. What was a mysterious idea that I used to mispronounce with a soft g, is now - if ever so slightly - less mysterious. The possibilities and flexibility that version control seems to offer are becoming much more clear. Before these past two weeks I really didn't know what i didn't know, but quite quickly I am starting to uncover many things that I now know that I don't know. This is so very exciting, and I can't wait to learn these things as well as the many more things that I don't know that I don't know.
