## What is healthy nutrition?
Glad you asked. It depends on many factors, but here are some general guidelines I follow.
 -*"Eat food, not too much, mostly plants."
     - Michael Pollan*

> Plant-based whole foods are full of vitamins (enzyme cofactors) that can keep your cells pumping ATP and giving you energy to think, breathe, and move. While glucose is your cells' favourite form of energy, the food we eat contains many different variations of glucose, known as carbohydrates as well as other macronutrients such as proteins and fats. Stabilizing blood sugar levels with healthy polyunsaturated plant-based fats and essential amino acids found in proteins as well as complex carbs can help maintain energy levels thorughout the day and avoid junk food binges or cravings. After a few months of eating clean plant-based foods, your taste buds will adapt, and you will no longer crave those salty and sweet snacks that don't add much to your health.

> I recommend checking out Michael Gregor's cookbook ["How not to Die"](https://www.amazon.com/How-Not-Die-Cookbook-Recipes/dp/1529010810/ref=asc_df_1529010810/?tag=bingshoppinga-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid={creative}&hvpos={adposition}&hvnetw=o&hvrand={random}&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=e&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl={devicemodel}&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=&hvtargid=pla-4583726542133522&psc=1) as it has some delicious and healthy recipes backed by a very thorough examination of the scientific peer-reviewed nutrition literature. Dr. Gregor also has a great [youtube channel called Nutrition Facts](https://www.youtube.com/user/NutritionFactsOrg).
