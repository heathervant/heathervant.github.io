I am a neuroscientist, concussion recovery coach, and data scientist wanting to make the world a better place. 
I hope to build collaborative research and health-care systems to advance research and care for many chronic diseases and expand our knowledge of how our brains work.


I strive to live a healthy, happy, balanced life and inspire others to dare greatly and lead with their hearts. My hobbies include rock climbing, soccer, backpacking, gardening, cooking, coaching, podcasts, audio books, yoga, and surfing. I love meeting adventurous, analytical and open people who also want to make the world a more inclusive, equal, sustainable, and peaceful place.

### More Information
I'm happy to connect via LinkedIn, twitter, or instagram to discuss all things data science, neuroscience, nutrition, biodiversity, food security, climate change, outdoor adventures, zero waste living, and mindfulness.
