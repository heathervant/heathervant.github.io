I am a data scientist and gut-brain health coach, and speaker wanting to make the world a better place. 
I hope to build equitable, cutting edge software and data analytics to create a more just and sustainable world.
I also have a passion for promoting multi-disciplinary and holistic health research and approaches to advance personalized care for people with chronic diseases. I am also endlessly fascinated by how our brains work and the similarities to neural network algorithms.


I strive to live a healthy, happy, balanced life and inspire others to dare greatly and lead with their hearts. My hobbies include rock climbing, soccer, backpacking, gardening, cooking, coaching, podcasts, audio books, yoga, and surfing. I love meeting adventurous, analytical and open people who also want to make the world a more inclusive, equal, sustainable, and peaceful place.
