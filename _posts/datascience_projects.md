title: My data science projects
---

I would like to showcase a few of the many data science projects that I have worked on here.

This is an ![interactive dashboard](https://mikeymice.shinyapps.io/mentalhealth/) with a geographical map of mental health survey results, built with R shiny.

This is a software package I built with my classmates for data cleaning, in R and ![python](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/CleanPy).
